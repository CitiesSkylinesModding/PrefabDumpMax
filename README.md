# Prefab Dump Max
The repo consists of two folders, one is Dumps and another is Mod.

## Dumps
* This folder contains Prefab Dumps to browse any and all Prefab assets in the vanilla game.
* Each game version's dump will have a heavily compressed zip (using 7zip) for easy download and a log, but only the current version will be unzipped as files.
* Somewhat of a known issue: the UnityObjectsMap ID on the prefab files are known to differ between dumps, so those line changes **should be ignored**.

## Mod
* This folder contains a simple mod to create the prefabs. The mod is based on the idea of yenyang's Prefab ID Dump. there's also a zip for direct download of the mod.

* 1.1.2f1 - 2024-07-11 - 40053 prefabs
