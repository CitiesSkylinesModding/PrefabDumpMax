# Prefab Dump Max
The repo consists of two folders, one is Dumps and another is Mod.

## Dumps
* This folder contains Prefab Dumps to browse any and all Prefab assets in the vanilla game.
* Each game version's dump will have a heavily compressed zip (using 7zip) for easy download and a log file listing all prefabs. (The unzipped current version has been removed to reduce file count)
* Somewhat of a known issue: the UnityObjectsMap ID on the prefab files are known to differ between dumps, so those line changes **should be ignored**. (From 1.1.8f1, I've replaced all UnityObjectsMap ID to `x*(2^5)` (previously `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`) so it's easy to track other differences.)

## Mod
* This folder contains a simple mod to create the prefabs. The mod is based on the idea of yenyang's Prefab ID Dump. There's also a zip for direct download of the mod.
